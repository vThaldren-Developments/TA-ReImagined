some packets



Ping:
 + idFrom       : 6340466
 + idTo         : 6340478
 + lpData       : F×ÿÿ$02

	JÛ¢$00			a number
	$00$00$00$00
	r¿`$00			ID for sender

Then you answere

 + lpData       : ÿÿÿÿ$02

	JÛ¢$00			Same number
	…¹œ$00			How long did it take?
	r¿`$00			sender ID



Typ 6 är väl vad som är just nu.. Baninställningar och sånt



Before launch "-packet" is sent (?)

dword			playerid
byte			player number. server is $1

One for each player if you are server

Server also sends an extra with itself



During unitsyc, server receives $17. It answeres with $18$01 and then sends unitsync.

Spel

Det skickas hela tiden , -paket, de är nog speldata

Emellanåt skickas ett )-paket, riktat


Hmm paket verkar kunna bäddas in i ett Send-anrop. Tex blev ett $5-chat paket inlagt i mitten av ett ,-paket.
Senare kommer det dock ett ensamt. <nej följs av ett ,-paket i samma data s.a.s efter 64 bytes som är
storleken på ett $5>


-------

Paket. Längder anges exklusive kind-byten ($1a på den första tex)


$1a			- syncpacket, 13 bytes length
byte			- subtyp
dword			- ??
dword			- unitnr

Subtyp = $3
word			- $01$00 = tell a client that this unit exists or if it shouldn't be used. First time
				   client sends crc on unit
			- $01$01 = tell client that it is synced 
word			- limitation

Subtyp = $2
dword			- checksum

Subtyp = $0
Öh helt tom

subtyp = $1
word			- $12$01 .. ?? Number of answerpackets it will send (number of units) this will be sent by client

word			- 0..?

subtyp = $4		- Looks like it is comming as an answere on $7-packets. during next burst.
