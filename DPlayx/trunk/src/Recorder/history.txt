- Reduced spamminess of .voteready.
- aliased .voteready command to .ready.

  touched while the sharelos code was only partially installed.
  This means code injection occurs once TA Demo recorder bootsup at startup. 
  Before any of the injected code can be touched.

v0.99b3.503

- ShareMapPos only generates events when the map view changes, 
  instead of spamming the connection

- Command reporting fixed up so it doesnt spam the chat.
- Fixed some issues with the .take code

v0.99b3.472
- Added .polldp command. Reports the DirectPlay Players known on each client with the same of greater version 
- Cleanup how TDPlay.GetPlayerName reads the player's name (Reverse engineering a known data structure is stupid)
- Working on why multi-lines of text are sent to a player once they rejoin.
  Results from TA sending a broadcast msg, and Dplay sending multipule messages to the same location.
  Even when Dplay does not report the players at the duplicate point.

v0.99b3.462
