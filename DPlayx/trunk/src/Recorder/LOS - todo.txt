[18:50:54] <Gnug215> Hmm, I think one suggestion I had was a "chatroom" for watchers in the game.
[18:51:06] <Gnug215> Or well, just the ability to chat for watchers, that the players didn't see.
[18:51:17] <Gnug215> And uhm, a cursor for the Ctrl-F2 box.
[18:51:50] <Gnug215> And maybe checkboxes. Like "Activate Shootall/Noshake/Shareall" etc.
[18:51:55] <Xon> ^_^
[18:52:13] <Xon> these are actually good suggestions
[18:52:19] <Gnug215> Yay!
[18:52:34] <Gnug215> Well, I mean, if you ever delete the macro stuff.
[18:52:39] <Gnug215> You have to re-write everything.
[18:52:50] <Gnug215> You can't jump lines, and you can't copy paste.
[18:52:51] <Gnug215> It sucks!
 <Gnug215> Is there any way to make a "chat log" show or something?
<Gnug215> Did I remember to suggest a visible blinking cursor in the battleroom chat? :)


[19:55:47] <Gnug215> Hey, how about making shortcuts for the commands?
[19:55:53] <Gnug215> Like, setshareenergy 1000
[19:56:07] <Gnug215> could be +sete 1000
[19:56:12] <Gnug215> Or +she 1000
[19:56:28] <Gnug215> Or +ssh 1000
[19:56:35] <Gnug215> And +ssm 1000

<DopeFishhh> ggs can you make it so that it automatically does +shareradar when you .sharelos

Increase the max text length ingame chat?

Yes, thats right. I've restarted work on TADR.

Working off the 0.99b3 513 codebase, the new version will have a few improvements over the standard 0.99b2 version.

[list]
[*]Increased stability.
[*]+5000 unit support. 0.99b2 only supports 500. Anything more and you start having some issues with a few of the features.

[*]Sharelos improvements:

- It is no longer posible for the recorder to get confused when typing .sharelos ingame.

- [b]+view and .sharelos now work together! [/b]

[*] Major Bug fix for TA: TA does not handle players dropping/being kicked from the battle room properly. This causes multi-line text when someone drops rejoins. This also trashes the recorder. TADR implements a fix for this now.

[*]Autopause - automatically pauses the game when you get into the game. Great for team games were you teamup ingame.

[*].cmdwarp will now work if a new person joined after the host typed it.

[*] Bundling Gnome's Extended chat interface(with permision) 

[*] 5000 unit limit. No need to alter the exe, just use TADR!
[/list]

There are a number of improvements still in the works, and I will add more as they are good enough to be included. 

Features in the pipeline:
[list]
[*]The actual recorder itself will be external to TA, thus crashes which kill TA will not corrupt the .tad file.
[*]Universal ancient TADR .tad format + server version to new version converter 
[*]New replayer server version
[/list]

Potenial feature list:
[list]
[*] Improvements to sharelos have been strongly considered, but will be time consuming to implement.
[*] CD check bypass. No need to alter the exe, just use TADR! (Legal issues?, will only include if Nexus & others OKs it)
[*] Integration of Prognosis's "TA Battleroom Text Scrolling" hack (optional)
[*] Resurrection and integration of Prognosis's TA4 scripting project.
