The following operations are specifically identified as being safe to perform inside a DllMain function: 

·Initialization statics and globals. 

·Calling functions in Kernel32.dll. This is always safe since Kernel32.dll must be loaded by the time DllMain is called. 

·Creating synchronization objects such as critical sections and mutexes.

·Accessing Thread Local Storage (TLS). 


The OS loader lock prohibits:
·Dynamic binds. That includes LoadLibrary/UnloadLibrary calls or anything that
 may call implicitly call them

·Locking of any kind. If you are trying to acquire a lock that is currently
 help by a thread that needs OS loader lock (which you may be holding),
 you'll deadlock.

·Cross-binary calls. As been discussed the binary youre calling into may not
 have been initialized or have already been unutilized.

·Starting new threads and then wait for completion. As discussed, thread in
 question may need to acquire OS lock that you are holding.

So we on-demand load stuff and work out some better finalization code

  A 2 stage process to thunk between the TA exe and the TADR init code.

  The 1st stage is a thin asm shim which thunks betwen the raw asm of the TA exe
  and the pascal code in the 2nd stage.
  The 2nd stage is written in pure pascal, and handles calling the dynamic
  InitCode function and Unsplicing the jump insert.
